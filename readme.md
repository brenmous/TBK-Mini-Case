# TBK Mini

Fork of https://github.com/bastardkb/tbk-mini.

Trying to modify the case to accommodate this [little fucker](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3870)
as a battery cutoff for my [ZMK TBK Mini](https://github.com/brenmous/tbk-mini-zmk).

My 3D printer is in the mail but I'm so excited/upset with my retrofitting
efforts that I'm working on this now.

## How do?

There's .stl files and an .f3d file for the orignal design.

I had installed OpenSCAD and imported the STL before the Fusion360
snap finished installing (which probably would've been a hassle to
get running anyway), so I'm going with OpenSCAD.

This is my first time doing any 3D modelling or CAD.

My approach is to recreate the button and position it in place
so the part the button extrudes from is flush with the outside of
the case.

The button shape isn't quite right. The body is a rectangle with about
a third of a cylinder for each end. I haven't worked out how to best do
that, so I've made the base of it slightly larger to allow the button
to fit. It won't be snug but it's getting epoxy'd in and the hole for
the button will align it.
